Problems to fix:

- 05 17 16:  DynamicValue or Main are producing bad results - check the simulation
values in the third row.  A non-eq transition is recorded in the second period, from
3 to 2, but it doesn't seem like that's right.  Also - the figure in NEQLev2Comp1 is
much bigger than the figure for the level 1.  This can't happen (shouldn't).
