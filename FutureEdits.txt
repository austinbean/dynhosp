Problems to fix:

- 05 17 16:  DynamicValue or Main are producing bad results - check the simulation
values in the third row.  A non-eq transition is recorded in the second period, from
3 to 2, but it doesn't seem like that's right.  Also - the figure in NEQLev2Comp1 is
much bigger than the figure for the level 1.  This can't happen (shouldn't).

- 05 18 16: Add the full year worth of data to the quarterly choices.

- 05 18 16: Add the other hospital levels - change the data

- 05 18 16: how can the optimizer converge when there are going to be columns of zeros
for a lot of the functions?  some states are never visited.  Maybe these don't matter
for convergence since it's in f(x) not x, but in principle I think it's worth correcting that
by dropping those columns or something.

- 05 18 16: is there an issue with all the parameters being estimated at once?  Will it always
converge to 0?
