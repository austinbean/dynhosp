`ValApprox(D::DynState)`
This computes the dynamic simulation across all of the facilities in all of the markets.
- Results are stored in the Dyn record.  That is, values.
- These are accessed as dyn.ll[#].visited.[(neighbors, level)].aw
- the probabilities associated to the values are in dyn.all[#].visited[(neighbors, leve)].psi 
- there is a count of each state in dyn.all[#].visited[(neighbors,level)].visited.
- V is of type allvisits, which records which states was visited in the last million iterations.  

TODO - where is the shock added and what is the variance of the shock?  It should be the normalizing constant.

TODO - probabilities are not getting recorded properly: 

dyn.all[1].visited[(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1)].aw

  1  => 0.0228582
