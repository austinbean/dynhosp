Problems to fix:

- 05 17 16:  DynamicValue or Main are producing bad results - check the simulation
values in the third row.  A non-eq transition is recorded in the second period, from
3 to 2, but it doesn't seem like that's right.  Also - the figure in NEQLev2Comp1 is
much bigger than the figure for the level 1.  This can't happen (shouldn't).

- 05 18 16: Add the other hospital levels - change the data

- 05 18 16: is there an issue with all the parameters being estimated at once?  Will it always
converge to 0?

- 06 01 16: Parallelize PerturbSimulation
    • For each market, we need N+1 cores, 1 for the main simulator, which does all
    hospitals under their equilibrium, then N to do Perturb for each of them separately.

- 06 01 16: DONE - Shell script for rapid setup of Amazon instance - see "shell_script.sh" ✓

- 06 01 16: Module to import and add all needed elements: data and programs - general improvement to
non-interactive use of commands.  Note that parallelizing presents special requirements.  It seems like
some difference is made by addprocs() after the REPL is run vs. julia -p 3.  Why I do not know.

- 06 01 16: Change main function in at least two ways:
  • Need to incorporate a number for the monte carlo sims
  • Need to change the storage container method
  •

- FIRST THING 06 02:
  Fix the module.
  Make sure all of the functions work.
  Remember what was commented: reimporting the DataFrames thing - not needed.
  Add the data importing to the module.
