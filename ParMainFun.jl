- Should be run in a construction like @parallel (+) for i = 1:nsims... etc.
- This does one stupid thing: the fid, year and mkt_fips are appended to the beginning of the record.
- This means they are added together with the linkage operation (+) in the @parallel for
- Divide by nsims to recover the right values.
